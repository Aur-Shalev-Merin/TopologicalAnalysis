#Local Cellular Structure
This repository provides a julia package to perform topological analysis using the local structure of the Delaunay tessellation.

The inputs are csv files of 2D or 3D point clouds, the outputs are distances between those point clouds.

Demonstration scripts are provided in /examples/
